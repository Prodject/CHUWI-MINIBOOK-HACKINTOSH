## Basic Usage

1. Create a bootable Mojave or Catalina bootable USB using this [tutorial](https://internet-install.gitbook.io/macos-internet-install/) OR this [tutorial](https://olarila.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=50&t=8685)(arguably easier but must register) but use my CLOVER folder at the point where you should configure CLOVER bootloader
2. Boot from this usb then install Mojave/Catalina on a free partition of your drive ( please note...must be installed to ssd as macos does not detect emmc )
3. During first boot, after installing the OS, mount your EFI partition and place the CLOVER folder alongside other OSes bootloader
4. Reboot and change BIOS bootloader order to have clover bootloader as first entry
5. Open your config.plist and generate a new serial number [Tutorial here](https://hackintosher.com/forums/thread/generate-your-own-hackintosh-serial-number-board-serial-number-uuid-mlb-rom-in-clover.306/)
6. Install additionals drivers
7. Reboot and enjoy !


## Changing the display orientation

To correct the display orientation within macOS, press and hold down cmd+opt (Windows+alt) and open System Preferences. Keep holding down those two buttons and click on Displays. The screen orientation option will now appear even for the built-in display. Set it to 270 degrees for the correct orientation.


## Enabling HiDPI mode

to enable HiDPI mode ( adds 960 x 600 ) enter the following command in terminal post-installation then reboot:

sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.windowserver.plist DisplayResolutionEnabled -bool true
